##### Definition/Explanations

An email or a URL \(landing page\) that provides more information on the resource

**Recommended usage**

You can indicate a contact point where users can solicit further information in the following ways:

* add a general email address \(e.g. resource@example.com\) where people can ask for more information, or a landingPage \(e.g. a page with documentation, examples and links to the resource itself\) at "contactPoint" address
* depending on the choice, select the appropriate contactType \(email or landingPage\)
* you can also add the data of a contactPerson or contactGroup, adding an email address for them

For corpora and workflows created in the OpenMinTeD platform, the landing page with the metadata record and the contact details of the person are inserted automatically.
