### â€‹Achieving compatibility with OpenMinTeD and interoperability across TDM resources {#how-to-make-your-knowledge-resources-interoperable}

In addition, if you want to be fully compliant with the OpenMinTeD interoperability requirements, please
*   ensure that the resource is distributed under Open Access conditions
*   include in the metadata record a link to the licence document that describes the terms and conditions under which it is provided, and attach the licence document together with the resource; using a standard licence, such as [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) the most recent version, is recommended
*   if you already have a PID for your resource (e.g. a URI or a HANDLE), make sure it is included in the metadata record (cf. [identifier](/models_identifier.md) for more information)
*   provide linkage between your resource and other resources (domain-specific or generic resources); for links between knowledge resources in the Linked Data paradigm, mapping should be expressed through RDF statements, using relations from [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/), together with the following OWL and RDF object properties: _owl:sameAs_, _owl:equivalentClass_, _owl:equivalentProperty_, _rdfs:subClassOf_, _rdfs:subPropertyOf_
*   version all your resources and label the versions in an unambiguous way, preferably following the [Semantic Versioning recommendations](/semver.org).

The following recommendations contribute to interoperability but are not yet enforced:
* for annotation resources:
  * you must provide the resource in a standard format, preferably XML or JSON-based syntax, or any other RDF serialisation format \(e.g. Turtle or N3\)
  * all elements in the knowledge resource must be identified with a URI; for Linked Data resources, the following identifiers should be used:
    * JSON-LD - the @id keyword
    * RDF/XML - the attributes xml:base, rdf:ID and rdf:about
    * XML - the xml:id attribute
* for ML models:
  * you must register them independently of any component that uses them, e.g. in a separate Maven artifact.
* for the metadata description of all resources
  * It is important that you provide the appropriate documentation for your resource (e.g. publications about the design and construction of the corpus etc.), which you should also version along with the knowledge resource and add as reference to your metadata record.
  * Recommend one of the publications about your resource as the one to be cited for scholarly attribution and add this information in the metadata record.
  * Make sure that you fill in the metadata record all the elements required for citing your resource[^1], i.e. the creator of the resource, a title, the resource type and an identifier, and optionally, the publication date, the version and the publisher or distributor of
  * Use standard classification vocabularies (e.g. [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/), [DDC](https://www.oclc.org/dewey.en.html), [LCSH](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) etc.) for adding classification tags to your material and specify the vocabulary you use in the metadata record; provide at least one broad category for your material (e.g. life sciences, computing etc.).
  * In all cases, where linking to other resources or entities (e.g. persons, projects etc.) in the metadata records is added, please try to do this through unique and persistent identifiers of authority lists and sources, to the extent possible, documenting also the authority and/or scheme it adheres to.


In the case that you provide the resource
* in another format, given that adherence to Linked Data standards is not imposed
* packaged in Maven artifacts with the components that use it, at the expense, however, of reusability

you still qualify for partial compliance.
