## Sharing ancillary knowledge resources through OpenMinTeD {#instructions-for-providers-of-ancillary-knowledge-resources}

Ancillary knowledge resources can be registered only by authorised users.

If you wish to register such a resource, you must provide

* direct access to the contents of the resource and
* describe it appropriately with a metadata record compliant with the [OMTD-SHARE schema](/guidelines_for_providers_of_ancillary_resources/recommended_schema_for_lexicalconceptual_resources.md).

Further requirements are dependent on the mode of providing the resource:

* if the resource is being provided for upload to the OpenMinTeD registry, please package it as a zip file preserving the original folder structure
* if the resource is available as part of a Maven artifact, please provide the appropriate Maven coordinates in the relevant metadata element
* if the resource is offered with a SPARQL endpoint or at a URL from where it can be accessed or downloaded, please provide the relevant link in the relevant metadata element.

As regards the metadata record, you can supply it as an XML file and directly upload it into the registry or use the OpenMinTeD editor. Where possible, e.g. in the case of providing a Maven artifact, metadata may be, at least partially, converted from the existing descriptors. In all cases, you will be notified of the availability of converted metadata at the time of uploading.
