free text or identifier
##### Definition/Explanations
Publication to be used for citation purposes as requested by resource providers (usually a scientific article that describes the resource)
##### Recommended usage
The preferred option to refer to a publication is by providing its unique identifier already assigned by an authoritative source; the preferred identifier for publications is DOI; you can use either
* the attribute "publicationIdentifierSchemeName" to specify the scheme, by selecting one of the pre-defined values \(e.g. DOI, ISBN etc.\) or,
* if the scheme is not listed among them, use the "other" value, use the attribute "schemeURI" to provide a link to the URL that documents the scheme it adheres to. 
If you don't know the publication identifier, you can provide the full bibliographic record as a free text format. 
N.B. The citation publication should not be confused with the attribution data which is a legal obligation; citation through publications is a common practice in research.
