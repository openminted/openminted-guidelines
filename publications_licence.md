##### Definition/Explanations

The licence of use for the resource

##### Recommended usage

You can provide information on the rights of accessing and using a resource in one of the following ways, in order of preference:

* use the element "licence" and select one of the recommended licences \(the values correspond to the SPDX codes\); please, note that the list contains licences intended for data resources & components mixed together; for components the recommended licences are the Open Source licences; for data resources, please use a standard licence such as one of the CC family
* if the licence you use is not included in the list, you can use the "nonStandardLicenceTerms" or the "proprietary" values and give further information on your licence in the elements: "nonStandardLicenceName", "nonStandardLicenceTermsURL" and "nonStandardLicenceTermsText"
* you can also select a value from the "rightsStatement" element if the resource is provided with a general statement of use and not an official licence document; please, note that this is an option used mainly to facilitate end-users in accessing your resource, while you are strongly advised to properly license your resource.
