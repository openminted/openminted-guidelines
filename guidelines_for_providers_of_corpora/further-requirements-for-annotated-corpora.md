### Further requirements for annotated/processed corpora {#further-requirements-for-annotated-processed-corpora}

Corpora can be registered in the OpenMinTeD platform

*   in an unprocessed format and annotated by the operation of TDM software also registered in the platform and/or
*   in an already processed format; in this case, they must be included as a separate resource with a specific metadata record including a specific set of [metadata elements](metadata-schema-for-annotated-corpora.md) (the same as for annotated publications).

It should be noted that corpora annotated by means of the OpenMinTeD platform will be automatically assigned the appropriate values for these elements.
