### How to register your resources {#How-to-share-your-resources}

Corpora can be registered by authorised users.

If you wish to register a corpus, you must:

*   provide a metadata record compliant with the [OMTD-SHARE schema for corpora, at least at the minimal level](/guidelines_for_providers_of_corpora/recommended_schema_for_corpora.md) which you can upload to the Registry as an XML file and/or edit with the OpenMinTeD metadata editor
*   provide a zipped file with the contents of the corpus or a link to a URL where the corpus is directly accessible (i.e. not a landing page); where possible, the zipped file should follow the folder structure recommended for OpenMinTeD publications, i.e. separate folders for contents, metadata records and licence documents.

If the corpus is stored at the repository of a network or infrastructure that allows harvesting (normally upon agreements made with OpenMinTeD), you can also provide the relevant identifier and this will be uploaded with the appropriate description. Where possible (and this will be appropriately indicated), the metadata description will be automatically converted to the OMTD-SHARE schema and presented to the user for further editing.
