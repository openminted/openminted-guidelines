# Guidelines for providers of corpora {#guidelines-for-providers-of-corpora}

OpenMinTeD facilitates the use of TDM technologies in the scientific publications world, ranging from generic scholarly communication to literature related to specific disciplines.

Corpora in the OpenMinTeD framework refer mainly to the _**collections of publications that will be used as mining source**_ in the TDM process. In fact, the OpenMinTeD platform includes a mechanism for automatically generating corpora based on user criteria selected from a faceted view of all publications provided by the OpenMinTeD partners - more details are included in the [**Federated content search and corpus building**](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md).

Corpora may also come from repositories of language resources, such as [META-SHARE](http://www.meta-share.eu) and [CLARIN](http://www.clarin.eu), or discipline-specific repositories, or uploaded by users for processing with TDM tools/services at their own personal workspace. 

Corpora uploaded in OpenMinTeD in this way do not have to be composed of scholarly publications. Examples include reference corpora \(i.e. corpora deemed representative of general language or a sublanguage usage\), news corpora, collections of domain-specific texts, such as manuals, etc. as well as annotated corpora, such as treebanks, morphologically tagged golden corpora etc. These corpora are not targeted as source of mining but can be _**used for training components**_ \(e.g. train a language model\) or for evaluating their performance or for ancillary purposes.
