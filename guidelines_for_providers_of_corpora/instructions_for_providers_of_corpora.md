### Uploading corpora in OpenMinTeD {#How-to-share-your-resources}

Corpora can be registered only by authorised users at the OpenMinTeD registry: [https://services.openminted.eu](https://services.openminted.eu).

If you wish to register a corpus, you must:

*   provide a zipped file with the contents of the corpus or a link to a URL where the corpus is directly accessible (i.e. not a landing page); where possible, the zipped file should follow the folder structure recommended for OpenMinTeD publications, i.e. separate folders for contents, metadata records and licence documents

*   provide a metadata record compliant with the [OMTD-SHARE schema for corpora, at least at the minimal level](/guidelines_for_providers_of_corpora/recommended_schema_for_corpora.md) which you can upload to the Registry as an XML file and/or edit with the OpenMinTeD metadata editor.

If the corpus is stored at the repository of a network or infrastructure that allows harvesting (normally upon agreements made with OpenMinTeD), you can also provide the relevant identifier and this will be uploaded with the appropriate description[^1]. Where possible (and this will be appropriately indicated), the metadata description will be automatically converted to the OMTD-SHARE schema and presented to the end-user for further editing.
