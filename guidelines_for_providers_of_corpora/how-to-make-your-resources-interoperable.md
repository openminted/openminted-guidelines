### How to make your resources interoperable {#how-to-make-your-resources-interoperable}

In order to ensure that your corpora can be mined in the OpenMinTeD platform, you must follow the same requirements that are set for scholarly publications. You must therefore

* provide direct access to the contents of each corpus
* describe each corpus with a metadata record compatible with the OTMD-SHARE minimal schema.

In addition, the following recommendations contribute to interoperability and make your corpora easier to process:

* The preferred **formats **for delivering textual material are plain text, XML, PDF \(not proprietary and certainly not of scanned images\), which can be read by one of the existing readers.

* If appropriate for your material, use one of the more specific **data formats **that are already covered by readers and converters \(cf. [dataFormatSpecific](/components_dataFormatSpecific_inside_inputContentResourceInfo_or_outputResourceInfo.md\)\)\)

* The preferred **character encoding** is UTF-8.

If you fail to abide to them, it might still be possible to process your corpora via the OpenMinTeD platform, but this cannot be guaranteed and interoperability with other resources will suffer loss.

So, if you intend to create a new corpus, it is important that you take into account from the early steps of its design, the requirements, standards, best practices and recommendations promoted by OpenMinTeD and other cooperating infrastructures.

Please, note that there are no general requirements yet for corpora to be used for ancillary purposes \(e.g. for training a tool\), as these are dependent on the requirements of the software that will use them and on the purpose of use.
