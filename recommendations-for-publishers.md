### Further recommendations for publishers

If you wish your material to be easily processable and interoperable with TDM tools and services, you should adopt the following recommendations:

* The preferred **formats** for delivering textual material are plain text, XML, PDF \(not proprietary and certainly not of scanned images\), which can be read by one of the existing readers.

* If appropriate for your material, use one of the **more specific data formats** that are already supported by readers and converters included in the OpenMinTeD registry \(cf. [dataFormat](/publications_dataFormat.md)\).

* The preferred **character encoding** is UTF-8.

* Further adoption of standards such as the [JATS article tag suite](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/index.html) or [TEI P5 guidelines](http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/) for annotating the inner structure of publications is recommended.

* Use standard classification vocabularies, such as [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/), [DDC](https://www.oclc.org/dewey.en.html), [LCSH](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) etc.\) for adding classification tags to your material and specify the vocabulary you use in the metadata record; provide at least one broad category for your material \(e.g. life sciences, computing etc.\).

* In all cases, where linking to other resources or entities \(e.g. persons, projects etc.\) in the metadata records is added, please try to do this through unique and persistent identifiers of authority lists and sources, to the extent possible, documenting also the authority and/or scheme it adheres to.

Please, note that not all of the above requirements are absolute: if your material is not compliant with them, it may still be processable, but their adoption makes it better equipped for TDM and NLP processing.
