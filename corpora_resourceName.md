Please, provide a short but descriptive and unique name for the resource, e.g. “British National Corpus” instead of just “corpus of English”. Provide the name in English; if you want to add names in other languages, you can use the “lang” attribute.   
For corpora created through the OMTD corpus building process, a resource name is automatically provided \(e.g. "Subcorpus of OpenAIRE with biochemistry articles created on 4/10/2016"\) but you can change it.
