### How to register your components {#how-to-share-your-components}

The recommended way of providing _**software components**_** **is through the Maven Central repository according to the following instructions:

* Please, put together in a single folder \(in the form that is required from the used technologies/frameworks\)
  * all files that implement the component \(e.g. Java classes etc.\)
  * licence text\(s\), preferably named as "LICENCE.TXT" in order to be unambiguously recognised; in the case of multiple licences, they should be all aggregated in the same file
  * a readme notice, that describes the contents of the folder as well as any important notice for the compilation and execution of the component
  * all descriptors \(UIMA/uimaFIT, GATE CREOLE[^1], OMTD-SHARE etc.\) available for the component according to the implementation framework,
  * a Maven POM XML file.
* Pack them as a JAR using the respective Maven plugin.
* Upload them to the Maven repository according to the Maven guidelines
* Finally, submit the Maven coordinates in the OMTD registry; in this case, the metadata record will be partially converted from the Maven POM file and, potentially from elements included in the metadata descriptors supported by OpenMinTeD \(UIMA/uimaFIT, CREOLE, and then you can enrich it using the OpenMinTeD editor.

[^1]: Details of GATE descriptors can be found at [https://gate.ac.uk/userguide/sec:creole-model:config](https://gate.ac.uk/userguide/sec:creole-model:config) although they do not currently contain many \(if any\) of the information needed to complete the OMTD-SHARE metadata descriptor. Note that this is changing to include more OpenMinTed like information much of which will be specified in a Maven POM rather than as CREOLE metadata. This is currently not documented as it relates to the next version of GATE that is still under active development.
