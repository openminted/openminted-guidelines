\#\#Guide for GATE components



For the current release of GATE \(which doesn't use Maven for plugin building/distribution\), there is a set of detailed slides and hands-on materials from our training course, that walk you through the steps of building a new plugin:

An update with documentation on how to use Maven to build and distribute a new plugin will soon be released.
