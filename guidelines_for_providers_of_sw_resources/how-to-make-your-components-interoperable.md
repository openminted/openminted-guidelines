### How to make your components interoperable {#how-to-make-your-components-interoperable}

In addition, if you want to be fully compliant with the OpenMinTeD interoperability requirements, please ensure that you adopt the following rules; if you fail to abide to them, it might still be possible to operate your software resources via the OpenMinTeD platform, but this cannot be guaranteed and interoperability with other resources will suffer loss.

*   Please, keep ancillary knowledge resources, e.g. models, annotation resources, etc., separate from the component itself; document and upload these also in the OpenMinTeD Registry following the procedure described in **_[Guidelines for providers of ancillary knowledge resources](/guidelines_for_providers_of_ancillary_resources/README.md)_**. If you want to refer to these resources from the software metadata record, please use the resource identifier for the linking.
*   To ensure that provided software components can be scaled as required for different workloads, it is recommended that they are implemented in a stateless fashion, i.e. without the need to maintain information about one or more documents and the need to share this information with other instances of the same component. E.g. a component that counts all tokens in a corpus cannot be trivially scaled.
*   In addition to plain UIMA/uimaFIT and GATE-CREOLE descriptors, OpenMinTeD also supports Argo descriptors; further instructions for deploying UIMA components in Argo are found [here](/guidelines_for_providers_of_sw_resources/guide_for_deploying_uima_components_in_.md).
