##### Recommended usage

The recommended way for referring to an organization is by giving their name \(in English\) and their identifier \(e.g. ISNI\); if you provide the identifier, please select also the relevant value from the list of values in the attribute "organizationIdentifierSchemeName"; if none is appropriate, please select "other" and use the "schemeURI" attribute to provide a link to a URL with more information about the identifier scheme.   
If you want to add names of the organiation in other languages, you can use the “lang” attribute.   
 The element can also be repeated to encode multiple organizations.
