# Guidelines for providers of scientific literature {#guidelines-for-providers-of-publications}

OpenMinTeD focuses on the use of TDM technologies in the scientific literature world, ranging from generic scholarly communication to publications related to specific disciplines. Scholarly publications come from a wide bulk of stakeholders, e.g. institutional and discipline repositories, academic journals, scientific publishers, etc. For the first phase, the focus is on **literature repositories and publishers**, as regards sources, and on **Open Access content**, as regards access conditions.

OpenMinTeD relies on existing infrastructures and standards/best practices for its operation. Thus, to access scholarly publications, it relies on the two main aggregators of such content, [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu) and [CORE](http://core.ac.uk).

If you are a publisher or a repository of scholarly publications and wish to provide your resources in OpenMinTeD for TDM purposes, you can:

* deposit them through one of the aggregators, following their respective guidelines and procedures - for more information, see [here](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/instructions_for_publication_repositories_librari.md),
* provide them directly into OpenMinTeD by implementing a content connector as described [here](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/instructions_for_aggregators.md).
