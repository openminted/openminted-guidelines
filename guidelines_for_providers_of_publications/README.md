# Guidelines for providers of publications {#guidelines-for-providers-of-publications}

OpenMinTeD focuses on the use of TDM technologies in the scientific publications world, ranging from generic scholarly communication to literature related to specific disciplines. Scholarly publications come from a wide bulk of stakeholders, e.g. institutional and discipline repositories, academic journals, scientific publishers, etc. For the first phase, the focus is on **literature repositories and publishers**, as regards sources, and on **Open Access content**, as regards access conditions.

OpenMinTeD relies on existing infrastructures and standards/best practices for its operation. Thus, to access scholarly publications, it relies on the two main aggregators of such content, [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu) and [CORE](http://core.ac.uk). 

If you are a publisher or a repository of scholarly publications and wish to provide your resources in OpenMinTeD for TDM purposes, you can:
* deposit them through one of the aggregators, following their respective guidelines and procedures - for more information, see ~~link~~,
* provide them through your API, using the content connector that has been built in the OpenMinTeD framework that allows harvesting of open access publications through the APIs of publishers that allow this. ~~further info or requirements for this??~~

If you're an aggregator of scholarly content, you must follow the procedure described ~~here~~.
