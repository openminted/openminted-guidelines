### Further requirements for annotated publications {#further-requirements-for-annotated-publications}

Scholarly publications will normally be imported into the [OpenMinTeD platform](https:\\services.openminted.eu) in an unprocessed format and will be annotated by the operation of TDM software also registered in the platform.

However, certain providers may decide to run the TDM or annotation software at their own premises and upload the results of the processing directly into OpenMinTeD \(e.g. annotating the publications with structural markup, recognizing acknowledgements or citations sections etc.\).

In these cases, the annotated output is considered a new resource and, therefore, should be registered 

* following the procedure for [sharing corpora](/guidelines_for_providers_of_corpora/instructions_for_providers_of_corpora.md)
* as a separate resource from the raw publication in a folder called "annotated files"
* with its own metadata record, using [metadata for annotated publications](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/metadata-schema-for-annotated-publications.md)
* encoded with the [XML Metadata Interchange](http://www.omg.org/spec/XMI/) \(XMI\) format, and most specifically with a [UIMA CAS](https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.9.0/references.html#ugr.ref.xmi).
