## Instructions for publication repositories, libraries, journals, publishers, etc. {#instructions-for-publication-repositories-libraries-journals-publishers-etc}

If you wish to register publications that can be harvested for TDM purposes through OpenMinTeD, you can do so

* by registering through [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu), following procedures and guidelines at: [https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action](https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action)

OR

* by registering through [CORE](http://core.ac.uk), following procedures at: [https://core.ac.uk/join](https://core.ac.uk/join)



For each publication, you must deliver:
* a file with the **full text** 
* a **metadata description** with at least bibliographic information about it, in preference following the OpenAIRE guidelines; these metadata elements are mapped into the OMTD-SHARE metadata schema and used for creating uniform facets for accessing the entire set of publications imported in OpenMinTeD from different sources (see [here](/deployment-scenario-of-publications-in-openminted.md) for more information on the deployment of publications in OpenMinTeD).

To be fully compatible with OpenMinTeD, you must
* ensure that the publications are distributed under Open Access conditions
* include in the metadata record of each publication a link to the licence document that describes the terms and conditions under which it is provided, and attach the licence document together with the publication
* if you already have a PID for your publication \(preferably DOI\), make sure it is included in the metadata record \(cf. [identifier](/publications_identifier.md) for more information on identifier schemes\).

If you wish to make your publications easier to process for TDM and NLP andprocessing, please follow the recommendations described [here](/recommendations-for-publishers.md).
