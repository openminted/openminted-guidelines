### How to register your resources {#uploading-instructions}

If you wish to register publications that can be harvested for TDM purposes through OpenMinTeD, you can do so

* by registering through [OpenAIRE](http://www.openaire.eu), following procedures and guidelines at: [https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action](https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action)

OR

* by registering through [CORE](http://core.ac.uk), following procedures at: [https://core.ac.uk/join](https://core.ac.uk/join)
~~
Add here procedure for content connector:
the content connector that has been built in the OpenMinTeD framework that allows harvesting of open access publications through the APIs of publishers that allow this. further info or requirements for this?~~





### Minimal requirements

For each publication, you must deliver:
* a file with the **full text** 
* a **metadata description** (compatible with the ~~OMTD-SHARE minimal schema~~) including the elements that are used as criteria for the end-user queries (see ~~link~~ for more information on the deployment of publications in OpenMinTeD). 

### Further recommendations
If you wish your material to be easily processable and interoperable with TDM tools and services, you should adopt the following recommendations:

* The preferred **formats** for delivering textual material are plain text, XML, PDF \(not proprietary and certainly not of scanned images\), which can be read by one of the existing readers.

* If appropriate for your material, use one of the **more specific data formats** that are already supported by readers and converters included in the OpenMinTeD registry \(cf. [dataFormatSpecific](/components_dataFormatSpecific_inside_inputContentResourceInfo_or_outputResourceInfo.md%29\)\).

* The preferred **character encoding** is UTF-8.

Please, note that not all of the above requirements are absolute: if your material is not compliant with them, it may still be processable, but their adoption makes it better equipped for TDM and NLP processing.
