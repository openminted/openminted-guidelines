### How to register your resources {#uploading-instructions}

If you wish to register publications that can be harvested for TDM purposes through OpenMinTeD, you can do so

* by registering through OpenAIRE, following procedures and guidelines at: [https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action](https://www.openaire.eu/validator/welcome.action)

OR

* by registering through CORE, following procedures at: [https://core.ac.uk/join](https://core.ac.uk/join)

For each publication to be valid for import into OpenMinTeD, a metadata record conformant with the [OMTD-SHARE minimal schema](/guidelines_for_providers_of_publications/recommended_schema_for_publications.md), and a file with the contents must be delivered.
