### How to make your resources interoperable {#technical-requirements}

To be fully compatible with OpenMinTeD, you must:

* provide a file with the actual contents of each publication in any format you desire \(e.g. PDF, HTML, etc.\).

In addition, if you wish your material to be easily processable and interoperable with TDM tools and services, you should adopt the following recommendations: 

* The preferred **formats** for delivering textual material are plain text, XML, PDF \(not proprietary and certainly not of scanned images\), which can be read by one of the existing readers.

* If appropriate for your material, use one of the **more specific data formats** that are already supported by readers and converters included in the OpenMinTeD registry \(cf. [dataFormatSpecific](/components_dataFormatSpecific_inside_inputContentResourceInfo_or_outputResourceInfo.md\)\).
* The preferred **character encoding** is UTF-8.

Please, note that not all of the above requirements are absolute: if your material is not compliant with them, it may still be processable, but their adoption makes it better equipped for TDM and NLP processing.
